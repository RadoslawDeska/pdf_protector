## Description
The program allows users to select a PDF file and encrypt its contents with a password.

The program allows to select files with **.pdf* extension, doesn't allow empty password and informs the user if the file is already encrypted.

## Running the script
To run the script either:
1) Python 3 is required with PyQt6 and pypdf packages installed. From this state you can either:
  - run the script from command line or
  - compile the executable using PyInstaller package (for which the compilation instruction files are available in the *.spec file).
2) If you trust the file, download the Windows executable from *dist* folder and run anywhere. It was created along with the side files thanks to PyInstaller package.
